ᝰ⠀⟡ DNI LIST ⟡
This is a personal space. I reserve the right to choose who engages with it.

⤷ Do not interact if you’re a Ratio hater, racist, anti-semitic, xenophobic, islamophobic, ableist, or LGBTQIA+phobic — including transmeds, TERFs, exclusionists, and anyone who disrespects identities or pronouns. If you joke about rape, use slurs you can’t reclaim, or believe racial minorities can’t be racist, you’re not welcome. The same goes for pro-shippers, anti-antis, comshippers, and anyone who claims “fiction doesn’t affect reality.” If you ship incest or pedophilia, fetishize LGBTQ+ pairings, identify as a fujoshi/fudanshi, or romanticize abuse, mental illness, or self-harm — don’t interact. This space is not for those interested in vore, gore, or other immoral content. I’m also uncomfortable with anyone from the Forsaken or CRK fandoms. And if you ship Sunturine or Neuvifuri, or take BL/Yuri to a weird obsessive level, stay far away.

⟡ Respect boundaries, or leave quietly. You won’t be missed.
